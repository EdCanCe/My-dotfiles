## Overview:

These dotfiles enhance the visuals and behavior of the following applications, be sure to have them installed before adding the dotfiles:

 - [**Kitty**](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) *(Terminal emulator)*
 - [**Neofetch**](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) *(System info)*
 - [**Picom**](https://github.com/yshui/picom) *(Compositor)*
 - [**Qtile**](https://qtile.org/) *(Window manager)*

For a matching VSCode theme, install [Retrowave Sunset](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EdCanCe.retrowave-sunset-theme), which matches the color scheme used in the setup.
